# HyperQ-Samples

Public samples that demonstrate how to use the HyperQ product.

## Hunt The Wumpus

Based loosely around the original Wumpus game. A character moves around a cave, there is a pit,
some food, treasure, and the Wumpus. If the character lands on the Wumpus or the pit, then they
die. If they run out of food, they die. The goal is to get the treasure and leave via the
stairs.

## LEM

Based on the original LunarLEMRocket game. Your LEM is landing and you tell it how much
fuel to burn in fixed time increments. The goal is to land at 0 mph with some fuel left.

## Rocket2

This is a more elaborate version of LEM. Your module is moving in orbit around the moon and you need
to give it controls to make it leave orbit and descend to the landing zone.
